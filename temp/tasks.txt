### ðŸ”¹ **1. Add Controlled Noise**

**Why**: Real-world demand fluctuates unpredictably.
**Suggestion**:

```json
"random_noise_factor": 0.1  // adds +/-10% Gaussian noise to daily orders
```

Add small randomness to demand after all calculations. You could even simulate user behavior variation due to weather, press, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Add Holiday Spikes (if not already)**

You simulate holidays in features â€” now simulate *demand lifts* on those days:

```json
"holiday_demand_spike_probability": 0.4,
"holiday_boost_factor": 2.5
```

Only apply to major holidays (e.g., BFCM, Christmas), not minor ones.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Vary `average_monthly_growth` Per SKU**

If you're generating >1 SKU soon:

```json
"variable_growth_per_sku": true,
"growth_range": [0.02, 0.15]
```

You can assign slower growth to niche SKUs and rapid growth to trending ones.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Improve Quantity Realism**

Instead of flat `[0, 8]`, use skewed distribution:

* 60% = quantity 1
* 30% = quantity 2â€“3
* 10% = quantity 4â€“8

That mimics what actually happens on Shopify (few bulk orders).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Add Shipping Delay or Fulfillment Delay**

If you plan to test lead time forecasts or churn:

```json
"fulfillment_delay_probability": 0.10,
"delay_days_range": [1, 7]
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Add Product Lifecycle Effects (optional)**

If simulating long time spans:

* Introduce demand decay after 6â€“9 months (to simulate seasonal/obsolete products)
* Use sigmoid or exponential decay
